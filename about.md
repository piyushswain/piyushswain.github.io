I am a **Web Developer**. I started coding in 2012 to create mods for my favourite games at the time. I am currently learning about UX Design and it's importance on the modern web. My goal is to help create and develop software that positively impacts millions of people.

I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering which I completed in 2019.

I currently work at **Nebulab**, which is a world leading full-service eCommerce agency based in **Pescara, Italy**, as a **Software Engineer**.

I work with some of the most innovative brands and on a wide range of ecommerce applications here and help provide extensions to **Solidus** which is an open source ecommerce framework for Rails.

I have previously worked as a **Full Stack Developer** and a **Senior Full Stack Developer** at **eLitmus Evaluation** in **Bangalore, India** which is a company that connects the best candidates with the best companies to give them both excellent professional opportunites.

I worked on web applications with varied uses ranging from a candidate portal to find jobs to an online testing and coding platform.

When I'm not working, I would generally be scouring the web for information on some obscure topic that has caught my fantasy or playing some game on my PC. From FIFA to Total War and Assasins Creed to Call of Duty, I have played almost anything and everything in between.

Also, I am an avid Football fan and a casual football player (Liverpool FC for life)
