title: Why being a "Misfit" can be a good thing!
---

Have you ever seen some people in your class or in your school or at your workplace who always seems to sit alone, wander alone, read alone and just seems lost in their own thoughts? They may seem weird, introverted, shy and even rude sometimes. They may have also been bullied or made fun of at some point of time. They seem to be a complete misfit in their surroundings, just lost and seem like they don’t belong there. Someone reading this may even think that they are one of those people. So, even though you may feel you are a misfit or not, I am going to tell you why it is awesome to be one. 

Being a misfit means you don’t fit in with the people around you and it makes you feel uncomfortable. You can’t blend in and have nowhere to hide and this forces you to take risks, fail and repeat again. You tend to overcome your natural shyness and introversion and grow to have your own identity away from the crowd. 

You will also build grit if you are in a situation where you are a misfit. It is a basic characteristic of a society or group to shed aside and tear down the ones who don’t follow their norms. Therefore, naturally misfits are ridiculed and picked on and this builds grit in an individual. The courage and resolve to not let others put you down is invaluable for any person.

Also being a misfit, the people around you don’t expect much from you and this gives you a freedom from the status quo and expectations that come when we blend into our surroundings. Especially in our deeply religious and ethnic and orthodox society, it turns out to be a boon. It will allow you to do your own thing and experience the sense of adventure and exhilaration that comes with it. The rush and the sense of empowerment this provides is unmatched by any drug available to mankind and all this is possible when you are or have been in a situation where you were a misfit.

Finally, you will develop empathy and respect for the people who appear to be different in any way shape or form. You will understand their plight and the situation they are facing because you will know how hard it is to deal with the feeling of being alone and misunderstood.

With whatever light you may look upon being a misfit, one thing that stands true is that it is not all sunshine and roses. But it brings with itself a sense of individualism that feels empowering when you realize it. A situation where you are a misfit forces you to grow as a person to the point that society can’t tell you that you fit in or not. So, I say be a misfit. Embrace the phase or try to put yourself in a situation where you don’t feel like you belong if you haven’t already felt like that because at the end of it you will come out as a much better version of yourself.
