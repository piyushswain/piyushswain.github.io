#### _The story of how we took a good platform and made it even better_

So, this story starts in October 2019, with me looking at a web application that I inherited from previous developers at the organisation I had joined 6 months prior to that day and thinking to myself that, "Here we have a perfectly functional web application that does it's job, but still why does it feel so underwhelming and out of place on the modern web".

### Realization

What I realized after 2 days of pondering on this topic was that, with the way web applications and their popularity has been growing in our times, The UX had become as important as the function of the web application.

* Back End or Server Side components
* Front End or User Side components
